## An advanced (very beta!) starter template for Joomla3.x

JoomlaPure is based on the [Pure framework](http://purecss.io/) from Yahoo. A fully featured tiny css framework.

- OpenGraph and Twitter cards
- Lazy loading social buttons
- Microdata markup
- WAI-ARIA Landmarks
- Image resizing and lossless compression
- Device specific content with mobileDetect
- 3rd party comments
- CDN options
- Custom 404 editor with referer email notifications
- Bonus extras to speed up your site

### Overview

All of my best practices put into one starter template for developers.

Out of the box the template can achieve 100% on Google's pagespeed analysis, dropping to 98% if adding images with no dimensions (which can be automatically optimized), and also dropping a percent or two if you add Google's own services like webfonts and analytics.

Still in very early stages but stable enough to build a site out of!

Don't forget to publish the system plugin, there is currently no warning if it is disabled and the template won't work without it.

### Installation

The package installs a system plugin and the blank template.

There are currently no warnings about the plugin being disabled, so if you get a white screen after installing, make sure the plugin is enabled.
